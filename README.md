# better-title-for-uusprintman
Adds page name to uuSprintman's document title to make it better and make saving to bookmarks easier.

**Quick guide:**
1. Put better-title-for-uusprintman.user.js into Tampermonkey addon for Firefox and turn it on.
2. (Re)load some uuSprintman page with Ticket.

**Known issues: note that in current version:**
1. The document title is altered only in tickets (tasks).
2. The document title is set only once after loading uuSprintman, if you go to another ticket, you have to refresh the page to change the document title.
